What is the difference between summation and addition?

Addition is done between two arguments whereas summation happens over n elements."""

If you specify axis=1, NumPy will sum the numbers in each array."""

"""Cummulative Sum
Cummulative sum means partially adding the elements in array.

E.g. The partial sum of [1, 2, 3, 4] would be [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4] = [1, 3, 6, 10].

Perfom partial sum with the cumsum() function."""
