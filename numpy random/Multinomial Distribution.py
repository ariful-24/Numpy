"""Multinomial Distribution
Multinomial distribution is a generalization of binomial distribution.

It describes outcomes of multi-nomial scenarios unlike binomial where scenarios must be only one of two. e.g. Blood type of a population, dice roll outcome.

It has three parameters:

n - number of possible outcomes (e.g. 6 for dice roll).

pvals - list of probabilties of outcomes (e.g. [1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6] for dice roll).

size - The shape of the returned array."""


from numpy import random

x = random.multinomial(n=6, pvals=[1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6])

print(x)







"""Note: Multinomial samples will NOT produce a single value! They will produce one value for each pval."""
